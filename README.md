# COD-MW4
Originally COD-AW which was used in the original CODAW server

This is a very old script of mine which I started coding when I joined SA-MP newly, and soon with the help of another script xMx4LiFe (Now known as Rog, on the forums) helped me with a few stuff specifically.
This script was later leaked by xMx and he used it in his COD:AW release and removed my credits. This script was not maintained by me after 23rd of June, 2017.
The script contains all the source code and you'll find that it's very resembling to what Yousha or (I, previously) released.
